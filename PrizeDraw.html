        <h1>Prize Draw Rules<br> </h1>
        <h3> Article 1: Participation </h3> <p> CoachCab organises a prize draw for all participants that have filled in all questions of the management development survey. Without name and e-mail, the participant will be excluded from the prize draw. Participants can only participate once to the survey.Staff working for CoachCab or their relatives are excluded from the prize draw. </p> 
        <h3> Article 2: Prize draw </h3> <p> As soon as 100 participants have filled in the survey, the prize draw will be performed. An innocent child hand will draw the name of the lucky winner out of the 100 participants. In case the survey remains open, a second draw will be performed for the next 100 participants. It is entirely up to CoachCab to decide to close or open/re-open the survey.The result of the prize draw will be presented on the website www.coachcab.be. The winner of the prize draw will be personally contacted. The prize cannot be traded for cash. </p>
        <h3> Article  3: Ownership </h3> <p> The winner of the prize draw will be immediately owner of the prize after the draw. From then CoachCab is not responsible for any possible risks related to the prize. </p>
        <h3> Article 4: Publicity </h3> <p> CoachCab reserves the right to publish the list of winners the prize draws. The winners of the prizes agree to have a picture taken of him/herself and the prize at the time the prize is handed out. They also give CoachCab permission to use their images, in particular for its publications (e.g. website) </p>
        <h3> Article 5: Fraud </h3> <p> In case of fraud or any attempt at deception to obtain a prize, CoachCab will exclude the respective participant to the prize draw.</p>
        <h3> Article 6: Disputes </h3> <p> Given the nature of the prize draw, no disputes with respect to the prize draw are possible. </p>
        <h3> Article 7: </h3> <p> CoachCab will assure that it will comply to the current privacy legislation. </p>
        <h3> Article 8: </h3> <p> Participation in the prize draw implies acceptance of these rules. The regulations are available on the website <a href="http://www.coachcab.be/PrizeDraw.html" target="_blank"> www.coachcab.be/prizedraw  </a></p>
